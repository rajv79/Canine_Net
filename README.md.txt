# Canine Net (Dog Breed Image Classification)

Canine Net is a powerful dog breed image classification system developed as an independented. The system utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and leverages advanced CNN architectures, including MobileNetV2, to accurately classify images of dogs among 120 different breeds.

## Features and Highlights

- **Training on Extensive Dataset**: The Canine Net system has been trained on a comprehensive dataset of 10,000 images, representing a wide range of dog breeds. This extensive training dataset ensures robust learning and classification capabilities.

- **High Accuracy Classification**: By employing state-of-the-art CNN architectures, Canine Net achieves exceptional accuracy in identifying dog breeds. The system has been rigorously tested and boasts an impressive accuracy rate of 90%.

- **TensorBoard Integration**: Canine Net incorporates a TensorBoard callback, enabling comprehensive analysis and fine-tuning of the model. This integration allows for monitoring the model's progress during and after training, providing valuable insights for optimization.

- **Efficient Training with Early Stopping**: To enhance training efficiency and prevent overfitting, the Canine Net system employs an Early Stopping Callback. This technique optimizes the training process by automatically stopping the training when the model's performance reaches its peak, saving time and resources.

## Conclusion

Canine Net is a powerful dog breed image classification system developed using CNN architectures and trained on a diverse dataset of 10,000 images. By leveraging cutting-edge techniques and callbacks, the model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 90%. This project demonstrates the potential of CNNs in accurately identifying dog breeds from images and can serve as a foundation for further research and applications in the field of computer vision.
